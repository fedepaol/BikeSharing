## Bike sharing app
This is my first experiment with maps. I chose to use a mapview but maybe it could be refactored to use a MapFragment.

### Niceties
- The app (tries to) use the MVP pattern together with RxJava.
 
- The markers of the map are (almost) custom bitmap drawn using the canvas API.

- The loading animation is a compound view plus animation.

- I tried to implement (some) meaningful motion elements and to adhere to material design as much as I could.
